# Epic-Battle-Simulator
Object Oriented Design Course Project

I collaborated with Jasmine on this! (a fellow Northeastern Peer)

Our GUI is intellij specific. I have included images to demonstrate the input and output functionality of the GUI that has been created. A UML diagram is also included as an image! The purpose of this project was to build out a GUI from scratch to sit on top of a program.
